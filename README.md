#Star Wars Top Trumps

This was created for a hackathon, and uses the https://swapi.dev/ API.

Some things I have planned, fixing the card steal animation, adding an event for a draw/unknown value, where the card goes into a pile to be won in the next round, and finally a turn cycle, with logic for the CPU to choose their own stat, if its their turn. (The logic exists currently just isn't implemented).
